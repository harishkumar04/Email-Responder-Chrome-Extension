# Learning Prompt for FastAPI Line-by-Line Study

## Use this prompt to recreate the exact same learning experience:

```
I'm learning FastAPI by studying my existing email response generator project line by line. I want you to:

1. **Show me the actual code line first**, then explain it
2. **Break down each concept** with real-world analogies
3. **Explain WHY each line is needed**, not just what it does
4. **Update a reference file** on my desktop (/Users/harishkumarr/Desktop/FastAPI_Line_by_Line_Explanation.md) as we go
5. **Quiz me periodically** to test my understanding
6. **Use encouraging language** and celebrate my progress
7. **Focus on practical understanding** over theory

My project is located at: /Users/harishkumarr/Documents/projects/email_responder/backend/main.py

I learn best when you:
- Show code first, then explain
- Use analogies (like "think of X like Y")
- Explain the "why" behind each decision
- Keep explanations clear and practical
- Test my knowledge with quizzes
- Save everything to my reference file

Current progress: We've covered lines 1-14 and I understand imports, CORS, environment variables, and basic FastAPI concepts.

Continue from where we left off, maintaining the same teaching style and energy level.

## Learning Progress:

### Completed (Lines 1-14):
- ✅ FastAPI imports and setup
- ✅ CORS middleware for Chrome extension
- ✅ HTML responses and Jinja2 templates
- ✅ Pydantic BaseModel for data validation
- ✅ SQLite3 for database operations
- ✅ Type hints (List, Optional)
- ✅ JSON handling
- ✅ DateTime for timestamps
- ✅ OS for file operations
- ✅ Environment variables with dotenv

### Next Steps:
- Continue with line 15 (Gemini AI setup)
- Learn about try/except blocks
- Understand FastAPI app creation
- Study API endpoints and routing
- Explore database initialization

## Tips for Effective Learning:

1. **Take breaks** - Don't rush through too many lines at once
2. **Ask questions** - If anything is unclear, ask for clarification
3. **Test understanding** - Request quizzes to check your knowledge
4. **Make connections** - Relate new concepts to what you already know
5. **Practice** - Try modifying the code to see what happens
